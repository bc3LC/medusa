<small><i>  <a  name="1">[1]</a>Equivalent consumption expenditure is used instead of income as it is considered a better proxy for permanent household income since it fluctuates less in the long run [(Goodman & Oldfield, 2004)](#R1). The equivalent spending is calculated based on household spending relativized by the modified OECD equivalence scale, thus considering the economies of scale generated in households based on their size. The modified OECD scale values 1 for the reference person in the household, 0.5 for other people aged 14 or over, and 0.3 for other people under 14 years of age.</i></small>
