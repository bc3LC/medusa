# Package data 


## Household Budget Survey

The microsimulation model in which `medusa` is based  is built up with the microdata from the Household Budget Survey (HBS), a common statistic in all EU countries which is increasingly standardized and which has relevant potential due the large amount of socioeconomic information that it collects. The HBS provides information about household final consumption expenditure on goods and services and information on some socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of each household. The HBS provides information at two levels: one for households and their expenditures and the other for household members. For more information about the HBS click [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/household-budget-surveys).

Specifically, `medusa` contains the Spanish HBS micro-data for the time series 2006-2021 (to be updated soon for 2022). However, the annual databases have been slightly modified to include a larger number of socioeconomic variables and for a better understanding by the user.  Firstly, some socioeconomic variables have been renamed to make variable names more intuitive for the user. Secondly, new variables have been created based on the information collected in the survey. For example, new income variables are created: quintile (QUINTIL) , decile (DECIL), ventil (VENTIL) and percentile (PERCENTIL) . Also, and since `medusa` aims to facilitate gender-sensitive analyses, the model includes two variables that allow capturing gender implications: the gender of the reference person of the household and the degree of feminization of the household. Although the HBS already includes the gender of the reference person among its variables, the second variable is calculated using the information on the gender of the household members file. Thus, we calculate the percentage of household members who are women over 14 years (this age is used because it is considered the age at which individuals begin to have decision-making capacity) and then we divide the households into 5 groups based on the share of women:

- FD1: 0-20% (lowest feminization degree)
- FD2: 20%-40%
- FD3: 40%-60% 
- FD4: 60%-80% 
- FD5: 80%-100% (highest feminization degree)

For expenditure variables, the HBS data are reported using the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP). The COICOP is the international reference classification of household expenditure developed by the United Nations Statistics Division to provide a framework of homogeneous categories of goods and services according to households purpose. It includes categories such as food, clothing, housing, water, electricity, gas or other fuels. For more information about the COICOP classification click [here](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/unsdclassifications/COICOP_2018_-_pre-edited_white_cover_version_-_2018-12-26.pdf).

## Population census 

Although the HBS covers a representative sample of the population, the total population does not coincide with the data collected in the National Accounts. Therefore, in order to make the HBS data consistent with the National Accounts data, the population data from the survey would first have to be adjusted. To do this, `medusa` takes the EUROSTAT census data as of 1 January and calculates adjustment coefficients. The population data is available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00001/default/table?lang=en&category=t_demo.t_demo_pop).

## National accounting

Despite the fact that the HBS provides a very detailed image of the annual consumption of households, the aggregate costs of the survey are not aligned with the principles and data of the National Accounts, which builds its macroeconomic aggregates based on more complete sources of information. Therefore, sometimes (e.g. when price shocks come from a macro model), before the simulation the HBS data should be adjusted to make them consistent with the macroeconomic dimension. In these cases,  `medusa` takes the National Accounts consumption data and calculates an adjustment factor at the highest possible level of disaggregation.
